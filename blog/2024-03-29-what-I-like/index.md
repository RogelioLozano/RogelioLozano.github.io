What do I like?

[Great explain of chinese philosophy, Chinese Dialectical Thinking—the Yin Yang Model](https://philarchive.org/archive/XINCDT)

I like to learn and integrate it into my worldview.

I like to find new methods to learn and make the integrative process of information into knowledge more holistic.

I like to understand the world around me.

I love to listen to music.

I love to think and explore herustically how all I am changes or reacts or function every moment. 

I love to use my knoweldge and see how everythings fits together after reading about different topics.

I like to feel curiosity for what is in our planet, why it is here and how.

I love to feel energized and focused, so I love practicing 氣功.

I like to think of things that can't be seen, and how they impact the seen reality. I like to understand not obvious forces and mechanisms that power the movement of the reality.

I like to understand how the history impact the present and the civilization I'm living everyday.

I like to better understand why we do what we do as a society, and ask why are we focused on those things, are they really necessary or is just a very old force that still exits only for historical innertia?

I love my life but I do not accept everything as it is, I like to think are better ways to do this?

I deeply feel the pain and fear of others as I remember how it feel and how difficult it is to overcome it.

I like to think and feel that my life matters and it is relvant to our reality, to our world somehow, that I'm not only an irrelevant dissipative structure that lasts just a bit more than a tornado.

I like to feel the empowering sense that knowledge of our different sectors of civilization give me.

I like to learn how individuality and social distancing tendencies can be equilibrated with authority and social cohesion to balance my personality and be able to contribute but also to feel freedom to expose without extreme consequences my ideas.

I like to empower people around me with a mental state of freedom so they can feel less enslaved by current powerful states and at the same time direct them towards creative innovation. Not towards resentment, anger and ultimately criminal activity.

I like the balanced focus of oriental mindsets like buddism, taoism and confusionism.

I like to know whatever I am more and by knowing me more, know others. I like to increase my consciousness. 

I love to still joy spontaneously like a child and enjoy for moments those deep feelings.

I love to find ever better approaches to solve my problems. There must be a way to do what I want to achieve!

I love to write what I think.

I like to develop methods although I then have difficulty following them!

I like to reciprocate and cooperate instead of compete, I think the biggest ever competition is oneself, that is the harder contrincant.

I like to inspire a long-term view to foster challenging each other collaboratively instead of short-term competition.

I like to understand that the best way to help others is giving the living example of what I believe.
