<p>In Mexico there&#x27;s a business cycle every 6 years for the presidential elections. Economy activity goes down in the first year of the new administration.
The Business cycle has 4 stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>peak: max employment and production = protential production.</li>
<li>recession: start to decrease prodution and employment. Companies start to cut off budgets and lay off workers.</li>
<li>trough: Minimum production reached, maxium unemployment.</li>
<li>expansion: Production increases, less unemployment, more debt is created and increases interest rate -&gt; inflation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Capital deepening</strong>: INcrease in capital that is faster than increase in labor. Example: A bank has only 5 tellers but the queues get long. It then buys and installs 50 Automated Teller Machines (ATM&#x27;s). Is capital deepening as the bank increases machine (physical capital) but not the number of workers (tellers).</p>
<p>Mexico is a country of services  as it accounts for 58.8% of GDP while industry for 32.1% and agriculture for 4.1%.</p>
<p>To increase productivity, we must increase the <strong>factors of production</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Land</li>
<li>Labor</li>
<li>Capital</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technological advancements</strong>: Refers to changes in production processes or the invention of new products that serve as inputs to produce others. With techonological advances, we can increase the production as it afects the factors of production of capital and labor.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/economy">economy</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="I just read the book The Worldly Philosophers and to consolidate the ideas I wanted to write a summary here."><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/economic-ideas">Super short summary of The Worldly Philosophers</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-03-18T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 18, 2024</time> · <!-- -->12 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/RogelioLozano" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/RogelioLozano.png" alt="Rogelio Lozano" itemprop="image"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/RogelioLozano" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rogelio Lozano</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Explorer of principles of attraction of information</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I just read the book <strong>The Worldly Philosophers</strong> and to consolidate the ideas I wanted to write a summary here.</p>
<p>It is composed of many chapters that talk about different periods of the economic thinking focused on the personality and historical context of relevant economists, therefore it provides a more personal view behind the writters of economic theories.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="adam-smith">Adam Smith<a href="#adam-smith" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Adam Smith" title="Direct link to Adam Smith">​</a></h2>
<p>is the first that introduced the idea of accumulated wealth and the effects over the production of goods that would have. We thought about the market supply and demand. For example, there are many bourgeoisie that were competing against each other for the market demand of certain products, they in consequence require more workers to produce more and be able to sell the products at a lower price, so to win a higher market share. That implies hiring more workers, nevertheless, given that others are competing for producing those products at lower prices too, they also want more workers, therefore, the labor market forces to a rising of salaries paid to the workers. That implies higher earnings for that social class. This would hinder the benefits of the bourgeoisie. Nevertheless, there is a limit to the number of goods that the population required, and bourgeois families could only buy that much for their needs. Therefore, that imposed a limit to demand of certain products, diminishing the demand for employees and therefore aliviating the pressure of rising salaries, because less work force was required to satisfy the current demand of the product. For Smith, overall, there was a net increment in the produced goods and total wealth in the system via accumulation of wealth.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="david-ricardo-and-malthus">David Ricardo and Malthus<a href="#david-ricardo-and-malthus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to David Ricardo and Malthus" title="Direct link to David Ricardo and Malthus">​</a></h2>
<p>were actively collaborated and discussed their views about economics. The main difference in their viewpoint compared to that one Adam Smith is that the accumulated wealth would be limited, there was a boundary to the development of the economic machine: It was reach because of the tendency of this social class of workers to increase its number with each rising of salary, therefore, balancing the laboral offer in the market and reducing in consequence the salary offered by the bourgeoisie. It was not even desirable for it would lead to a Tragedy of the Commons. More mouths to feed would imply more production of goods, but the land can only offer a limited amount of goods that can be extracted and satisfy the demand given a period of time. Thus, the economic growth was capped. (A net-zero game).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="john-stuart-mill">John Stuart Mill<a href="#john-stuart-mill" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to John Stuart Mill" title="Direct link to John Stuart Mill">​</a></h2>
<p>was a well educated (he started to study greek at the age three and by 6 years old he already had read Plato&#x27;s Dialogues and many other greek poets and writters) English economist, he also learnt latin very young. His father raise him with a strict and elite education, that had the negative impact of Mill having  crisis in his twenties where while other discovered that there could be beauty in intelectual work, Mill found that there could beauty in beauty. His main statement was the idea to separate production and distribution. He stated that the economic laws are only concerned with production, the distribution is completely separate from those laws. He said:</p>
<p>&quot;The distribution of wealth depends on the laws and traditions of sociaty. The  rules that determine it are the opinions and feelings of those who govern the community; they are very different in distinct periods and distinct countries.&quot;</p>
<p>This reasoning has its flaws, distribution policies can have impacts over production. For example, if we tax 100% of the benefits, that will change where the money goes but also hinder the desire to produce more, therefore a distribution policy affects production! Also, as Marx pointed out, we cannot separate distribution from production completely, because how different sociaties organize their payment modes is a constitutive element of their production modes.</p>
<p>So the critics that Mill made concerning the freedom with which sociaties can reestructure their distribution of wealth has its limits. Nevertheless, its approach has importance, for the time, its ideas were considered a bit socialist (utopic socialism) but the concept of having the freedom to distribute wealth implied that government or other institutions could have an influence over the economic machinery and help to stabilize it, for example, via taxes on heritage and land rent. Also, in opposition to Ricardo and Malthus, he didn&#x27;t considered that the economic growth would reach a maximum and then decrase as a consequence of an increase in population that exerted a negative impact over the benefitis of accumulated wealth. Instead, he believed that with education, people could be informed about the negative impacts of non-controled natality, so population could be controled so salaries would only increase and reach a maximum of wealth accumulation. Therefore, in Mills model, the economy would reach a high stationary phase where we would see an end to the capitalism and the economic process and start a phase or stage of beingn socialism, where humanity would focus his energy towards higher ideals like justice and freedom. At the present time we can think of Netherlands or the three scandinavias (Norway, Sweden, Denmark) and see the elevated level of social responsability.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="karl-marx-and-friedrich-engels">Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels<a href="#karl-marx-and-friedrich-engels" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels" title="Direct link to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels">​</a></h2>
<p>had opposite different personalities. Marx was a German Scholar par excellence, slow, meticulous, exhaustively perfeccionist. Engels was happy, clever, energetic, communicative; he was fond of bourgeois pleasures and had a good palate for wine. Engels could quickly writte a treatise, Marx could get back over and over the same theme, endlessly. Engels talked multiple languages, Marx after twenty years of practice could only talk a horrible Teutonic English. Nevertheless, with all its weight, Marx was the most powerful mind of the two. Wherever Engels introduced amplitude, Marx contributed deepness.</p>
<p>Now, Marx was influenced by <em>Hegel</em> with its dialects theory, loosely speaking, Hegel&#x27;s dialect says that change is permanent, every idea, every force helps to grow its opposite, then after a tension they both get fused into one unity, which in turn produced its own contradiction. History, was the expression of that flux of contradictory forces and ideas in conflict.</p>
<p>In the dialectical materlialism, the root principle to understand the history is that the production of goods, and its subsequent distribution, determines the order of the society. As we saw with the counterexample for Mills&#x27; complete separation of production and distribution, the distribution has an impact in the production too. Given that the dialectical materialism proposes that the architecture of social order (in hierarchical classes) is determined by the distribution of goods that in turn is determined by what is produced and how it is produced, we see that it is all connected. The distribution allocates resources to certain members of society (which in turn create a new social class) is dependent on the relation that those members have with what is produced and how it is produced. Depending on the nature of that relation is the position that the newly created social class will have in its society and will or not maintain. Therefore, given that what is produced is related to how it is produced, then new products can be created when new techiniques and technological and scientifical advancements happen. For example, a new kind of mineral can be extracted from deeper places if there is the technical capacity to do it and perhaps a new class of technical positions will be created, <strong>perhaps, the more disruptive the changes in production the odds of allowing a new social class to emerge are greater</strong>. Or an existing way of producing wheat using manual grinders will be improved using vapor grinders or electrial grinders, therefore if there was an existing guild of manual operators of grinders, with the development of electrical grinders, that guild could be displaced by others or even just disapear exerting pressure over other sectors of society to emerge.</p>
<p>Dialectical materialism does not say that ideas are not relevant, but it says that people originate their ideas based on the production and distribution and society order they happend to live in, and the influence of those ideas were primarely originated from those afromentioned aspects.</p>
<p>In times of Marx and Engels, the prediction or natural consequence of the structure and operation of capitalism indicated that it had to finish. Its base class (proletariat) was beign oppressed by the middle top class (bourgeoisie, aristocrats) who had the means of production, the proletariat only had its work force to produce.</p>
<p>The ideal model of capitalism that Marx proposed is one that does not have monopolies and that the value of a product is the accumulated work required to produce it (being the same view that David Ricardo had in that aspect). Then given those conditions (among others, for formal details read Das Kapital), an equitative relation between the value of the proletariat&#x27;s work force and the value that should be paid for that is equal to the required subsistance of a proletarian, therefore if 6 hours of a man&#x27;s work is required to pay for its subsistance requirements, then that is what is going to be paid by the capitalist. If that were the case, the capitalist would not get any accumulated gains, but they get it by what Marx called <strong>surplus value</strong>, that is, they hired the proletarian to work for 8-10 hours per day and only pay them what they need to subsist. Then the capitalist can sell the product and obtain an extra accumulated gain. This is possible given that they own and monopolize the production modes according to the legal ordering of private property. Given that all the capitalist try to get benefits but are all in competition. Given that to generate benefits they have to expand, to grow, they require more workers, therefore they also have to compete for the labor force. <strong>This rise salaries</strong>. This rising of salaries have a negative pressure over the benefits the owners of the production modes, therefore, the way they find the way out of that is to buy machines that can substitute the labor force of living workers. With these machines they can satisfy the market demands that pressures them to expand and also diminished the negative pressure of the rising salaries of the labor market on their benefits. This machines will throw out into the street to many workers, so accomplishing the same function that the increment in population had for Smith and Ricardo, i.e., to compete for jobs in the labor market. Now, this only solves one problem but generates other, given that the surplus is only obtainable via the living proletariat, (machines in Marx model cannot produce surplus, if you bought the machine at 10,000, then you can only get 10,000 of equivalent work force from the machine). And even then, the benefits would decrease given the reduced population adquisitive power, and reducing the demand for products. So the end result is a reduction in the rate of benefits, this produces a capitalist crisis, the smaller go into bankrupt. This is not the end, just one cycle, the bigger companies can adquire the machines at lower prices from the smaller bankrupting companies, the works are forced to accept devaluated salaries and then slowly, the surplus begins to appear again and with it big benefits. Each crisis exists to renovate the expansion capacity of the system.</p>
<p>This is the concept Marx called <strong>laws of movement</strong> of historical development. The process of depressions (economic recession) or crisis is the way the capitalism system works, it is not a flaw it is the way it functions.</p>
<p>But each crisis is worse than the last one, given that the bigger firms absorb the smaller ones and when these industrial monsters fall, the harm to the society is stronger. This would lead to the colapse of capitalism in the end.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s great that Marx was able to predict economic cycles and consequences of those cycles over the long run of big industries, i.e., benefits tend to go down always. The only way to solve this is that the whole economy grows. This requires innovation, techonological progress. Companies are obliged to innovate. To sum up the model of dialectical materialism was great at predicting future process and events.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hobson-and-marshall">Hobson and Marshall.<a href="#hobson-and-marshall" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hobson and Marshall." title="Direct link to Hobson and Marshall.">​</a></h2>
<p>Then the Victorian Age started and almost all the formal economist saw the economy from the cold and static academic side. <strong>Marshall</strong> in his &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; described the economic machinery as a system of weights and counter-weight that balanced and allows to reach an equilibrium in the economy. It also considered for the first time the economic ideas separated from political economics, this is, the separation of economy from the ideas that related the distribution of power in hierarchical societies that ended up in creating a particular social order and their associated production and distribution of resources and goods.</p>
<p>On the other hand <strong>Hobson</strong>, was an english economist that worked on the concept of <strong>Imperialism</strong> as a new form of capitalism drived by the requirement of finding new markets to sell national products and avoid excesive offert and low demand if those products were only to be sell in their original national markets. The desire to find new markets to expand the earnings coupled with the searching of row materials (gold, silver, oil, etc.) prompted invasions of new territories and the period of colonialism that characterized the XIX century and the initial years of the XX century, actually this hunger for new colonies (opening up new markets and access to profitable commodities) led to wars between nations like Germany, Italy, England and France, this was part of the reasons that originated the first world war. Hobson&#x27;s works influnced Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s theory of underconsumption.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/economy">economy</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/history">history</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Connecting dots</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/RleLozano" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">𝕏<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/12706751/rogelio-lozano" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Stack Overflow<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/users/944274979372011592" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/RogelioLozano" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">© All the dots reserved.</div></div></div></footer></div>
