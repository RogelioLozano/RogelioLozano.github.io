Also, in opposition to Ricardo and Malthus, he didn't considered that the economic growth would reach a maximum and then decrase as a consequence of an increase in population that exerted a negative impact over the benefitis of accumulated wealth. Instead, he believed that with education, people could be informed about the negative impacts of non-controled natality, so population could be controled so salaries would only increase and reach a maximum of wealth accumulation. Therefore, in Mills model, the economy would reach a high stationary phase where we would see an end to the capitalism and the economic process and start a phase or stage of beingn socialism, where humanity would focus his energy towards higher ideals like justice and freedom.

Given that the dialectical materialism proposes that the architecture of social order (in hierarchical classes) is determined by the distribution of goods that in turn is determined by what is produced and how it is produced, we see that it is all connected. The distribution allocates resources to certain members of society (which in turn create a new social class) is dependent on the relation that those members have with what is produced and how it is produced. Depending on the nature of that relation is the position that the newly created social class will have in its society and will or not maintain.

This machines will throw out into the street to many workers, so accomplishing the same function that the increment in population had for Smith and Ricardo, i.e., to compete for jobs in the labor market. Now, this only solves one problem but generates other, given that the surplus is only obtainable via the living proletariat, (machines in Marx model cannot produce surplus, if you bought the machine at 10,000, then you can only get 10,000 of equivalent work force from the machine).
