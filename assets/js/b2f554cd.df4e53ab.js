We thought about the market supply and demand. For example, there are many bourgeoisie that were competing against each other for the market demand of certain products, they in consequence require more workers to produce more and be able to sell the products at a lower price, so to win a higher market share. That implies hiring more workers, nevertheless, given that others are competing for producing those products at lower prices too, they also want more workers, therefore, the labor market forces to a rising of salaries paid to the workers. That implies higher earnings for that social class. This would hinder the benefits of the bourgeoisie. Nevertheless, there is a limit to the number of goods that the population required, and bourgeois families could only buy that much for their needs. Therefore, that imposed a limit to demand of certain products, diminishing the demand for employees and therefore aliviating the pressure of rising salaries, because less work force was required to satisfy the current demand of the product. For Smith, overall, there was a net increment in the produced goods and total wealth in the system via accumulation of wealth. \\n\\n## David Ricardo and Malthus\\n were actively collaborated and discussed their views about economics. The main difference in their viewpoint compared to that one Adam Smith is that the accumulated wealth would be limited, there was a boundary to the development of the economic machine: It was reach because of the tendency of this social class of workers to increase its number with each rising of salary, therefore, balancing the laboral offer in the market and reducing in consequence the salary offered by the bourgeoisie. It was not even desirable for it would lead to a Tragedy of the Commons. More mouths to feed would imply more production of goods, but the land can only offer a limited amount of goods that can be extracted and satisfy the demand given a period of time. Thus, the economic growth was capped. (A net-zero game).\\n\\n\\n## John Stuart Mill\\n was a well educated (he started to study greek at the age three and by 6 years old he already had read Plato\'s Dialogues and many other greek poets and writters) English economist, he also learnt latin very young. His father raise him with a strict and elite education, that had the negative impact of Mill having  crisis in his twenties where while other discovered that there could be beauty in intelectual work, Mill found that there could beauty in beauty. His main statement was the idea to separate production and distribution. He stated that the economic laws are only concerned with production, the distribution is completely separate from those laws. He said: \\n\\n\\"The distribution of wealth depends on the laws and traditions of sociaty. The  rules that determine it are the opinions and feelings of those who govern the community; they are very different in distinct periods and distinct countries.\\"\\n\\nThis reasoning has its flaws, distribution policies can have impacts over production. For example, if we tax 100% of the benefits, that will change where the money goes but also hinder the desire to produce more, therefore a distribution policy affects production! Also, as Marx pointed out, we cannot separate distribution from production completely, because how different sociaties organize their payment modes is a constitutive element of their production modes.\\n\\nSo the critics that Mill made concerning the freedom with which sociaties can reestructure their distribution of wealth has its limits. Nevertheless, its approach has importance, for the time, its ideas were considered a bit socialist (utopic socialism) but the concept of having the freedom to distribute wealth implied that government or other institutions could have an influence over the economic machinery and help to stabilize it, for example, via taxes on heritage and land rent. Also, in opposition to Ricardo and Malthus, he didn\'t considered that the economic growth would reach a maximum and then decrase as a consequence of an increase in population that exerted a negative impact over the benefitis of accumulated wealth. Instead, he believed that with education, people could be informed about the negative impacts of non-controled natality, so population could be controled so salaries would only increase and reach a maximum of wealth accumulation. Therefore, in Mills model, the economy would reach a high stationary phase where we would see an end to the capitalism and the economic process and start a phase or stage of beingn socialism, where humanity would focus his energy towards higher ideals like justice and freedom. At the present time we can think of Netherlands or the three scandinavias (Norway, Sweden, Denmark) and see the elevated level of social responsability.\\n\\n\\n## Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\\n had opposite different personalities. Marx was a German Scholar par excellence, slow, meticulous, exhaustively perfeccionist. Engels was happy, clever, energetic, communicative; he was fond of bourgeois pleasures and had a good palate for wine. Engels could quickly writte a treatise, Marx could get back over and over the same theme, endlessly. Engels talked multiple languages, Marx after twenty years of practice could only talk a horrible Teutonic English. Nevertheless, with all its weight, Marx was the most powerful mind of the two. Wherever Engels introduced amplitude, Marx contributed deepness. \\n\\nNow, Marx was influenced by *Hegel* with its dialects theory, loosely speaking, Hegel\'s dialect says that change is permanent, every idea, every force helps to grow its opposite, then after a tension they both get fused into one unity, which in turn produced its own contradiction. History, was the expression of that flux of contradictory forces and ideas in conflict.\\n\\nIn the dialectical materlialism, the root principle to understand the history is that the production of goods, and its subsequent distribution, determines the order of the society. As we saw with the counterexample for Mills\' complete separation of production and distribution, the distribution has an impact in the production too. Given that the dialectical materialism proposes that the architecture of social order (in hierarchical classes) is determined by the distribution of goods that in turn is determined by what is produced and how it is produced, we see that it is all connected. The distribution allocates resources to certain members of society (which in turn create a new social class) is dependent on the relation that those members have with what is produced and how it is produced. Depending on the nature of that relation is the position that the newly created social class will have in its society and will or not maintain. Therefore, given that what is produced is related to how it is produced, then new products can be created when new techiniques and technological and scientifical advancements happen. For example, a new kind of mineral can be extracted from deeper places if there is the technical capacity to do it and perhaps a new class of technical positions will be created, **perhaps, the more disruptive the changes in production the odds of allowing a new social class to emerge are greater**. Or an existing way of producing wheat using manual grinders will be improved using vapor grinders or electrial grinders, therefore if there was an existing guild of manual operators of grinders, with the development of electrical grinders, that guild could be displaced by others or even just disapear exerting pressure over other sectors of society to emerge.\\n\\nDialectical materialism does not say that ideas are not relevant, but it says that people originate their ideas based on the production and distribution and society order they happend to live in, and the influence of those ideas were primarely originated from those afromentioned aspects.\\n\\nIn times of Marx and Engels, the prediction or natural consequence of the structure and operation of capitalism indicated that it had to finish. Its base class (proletariat) was beign oppressed by the middle top class (bourgeoisie, aristocrats) who had the means of production, the proletariat only had its work force to produce.\\n\\nThe ideal model of capitalism that Marx proposed is one that does not have monopolies and that the value of a product is the accumulated work required to produce it (being the same view that David Ricardo had in that aspect). Then given those conditions (among others, for formal details read Das Kapital), an equitative relation between the value of the proletariat\'s work force and the value that should be paid for that is equal to the required subsistance of a proletarian, therefore if 6 hours of a man\'s work is required to pay for its subsistance requirements, then that is what is going to be paid by the capitalist. If that were the case, the capitalist would not get any accumulated gains, but they get it by what Marx called **surplus value**, that is, they hired the proletarian to work for 8-10 hours per day and only pay them what they need to subsist. Then the capitalist can sell the product and obtain an extra accumulated gain. This is possible given that they own and monopolize the production modes according to the legal ordering of private property. Given that all the capitalist try to get benefits but are all in competition. Given that to generate benefits they have to expand, to grow, they require more workers, therefore they also have to compete for the labor force. **This rise salaries**. This rising of salaries have a negative pressure over the benefits the owners of the production modes, therefore, the way they find the way out of that is to buy machines that can substitute the labor force of living workers. With these machines they can satisfy the market demands that pressures them to expand and also diminished the negative pressure of the rising salaries of the labor market on their benefits. This machines will throw out into the street to many workers, so accomplishing the same function that the increment in population had for Smith and Ricardo, i.e., to compete for jobs in the labor market. Now, this only solves one problem but generates other, given that the surplus is only obtainable via the living proletariat, (machines in Marx model cannot produce surplus, if you bought the machine at 10,000, then you can only get 10,000 of equivalent work force from the machine). And even then, the benefits would decrease given the reduced population adquisitive power, and reducing the demand for products. So the end result is a reduction in the rate of benefits, this produces a capitalist crisis, the smaller go into bankrupt. This is not the end, just one cycle, the bigger companies can adquire the machines at lower prices from the smaller bankrupting companies, the works are forced to accept devaluated salaries and then slowly, the surplus begins to appear again and with it big benefits. Each crisis exists to renovate the expansion capacity of the system. \\n\\nThis is the concept Marx called **laws of movement** of historical development. The process of depressions (economic recession) or crisis is the way the capitalism system works, it is not a flaw it is the way it functions.\\n\\nBut each crisis is worse than the last one, given that the bigger firms absorb the smaller ones and when these industrial monsters fall, the harm to the society is stronger. This would lead to the colapse of capitalism in the end. \\n\\nIt\'s great that Marx was able to predict economic cycles and consequences of those cycles over the long run of big industries, i.e., benefits tend to go down always. The only way to solve this is that the whole economy grows. This requires innovation, techonological progress. Companies are obliged to innovate. To sum up the model of dialectical materialism was great at predicting future process and events."},{"id":"Last-stack-used","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Last-stack-used","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-14-sise/index.md","title":"Post-analysis of my last Software Project","description":"","date":"2024-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 14, 2024","tags":[{"label":"systems-design","permalink":"/blog/tags/systems-design"}],"readingTime":0,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Rogelio Lozano","title":"Explorer of principles of attraction of information","url":"https://github.com/RogelioLozano","imageURL":"https://github.com/RogelioLozano.png","key":"rogelio"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Last-stack-used","title":"Post-analysis of my last Software Project","authors":["rogelio"],"tags":["systems-design"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Super short summary of The Worldly Philosophers","permalink":"/blog/economic-ideas"},"nextItem":{"title":"Is frontend automation near?","permalink":"/blog/Automating-frontend"}},"content":""},{"id":"Automating-frontend","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Automating-frontend","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-11-automating/index.md","title":"Is frontend automation near?","description":"Will programming web applications be completely automated?","date":"2024-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 11, 2024","tags":[{"label":"AI","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"}],"readingTime":1.57,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Rogelio Lozano","title":"Explorer of principles of attraction of information","url":"https://github.com/RogelioLozano","imageURL":"https://github.com/RogelioLozano.png","key":"rogelio"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Automating-frontend","title":"Is frontend automation near?","authors":["rogelio"],"tags":["AI"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Post-analysis of my last Software Project","permalink":"/blog/Last-stack-used"},"nextItem":{"title":"What is a question?","permalink":"/blog/What-is-a-question"}},"content":"Will programming web applications be completely automated?\\n\\nThough question to answer. So let\'s analyze it and try to formulate a good response. The idea that comes to my mind to start exploring the landscape consists in approaching a principled consideration in order to accumulate knowledge and arrive to an informed conclusion.\\n\\n### Historical perspective\\nI\'ll just divide the pharagraphs for order of gradual evolution but was not a sequential process, all the advancements overlap in time, space, and industry axes.\\n\\nFirst, Alan Turing, John Von Neumann, among others developed the foundational concepts of computing and programming. This was a highly manual job, deep *understanding* of computer\'s architecture was required.\\n\\nSecond, advances in early machine code for specific computer architectures. Team led by Maurice Wilkes developed the concept of microprogramming (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1458043.1458047). A method of implementing the behavior of machine instructions by means of more elementary operations, with direct correspondence with the functions of the physical components of the computer. The control of instructions was hardwired, composed of circuits that corresponds with execution of each instruction. This was difficult to *modify*, expensive to *design* but fast. Microprogrammed allowed for simpler designs, easier to modify but slower than hardwired control.\\n\\nAssembly language emerged as a symbolic representation of machine code instructions. Instead of seeing addresses of instructions, programmers saw *abstract* symbols for instructions like read from memory, store into register rsp, etc.. This was easier to *understand*, *modify* and *maintain* as compared to raw machine code. Still, it was architecture instruction set dependent.\\n\\nThen, the emergence of higher-level programming languages. With all the widely known advantages in *portability*, *understanding*, *maintainability*, among others. For what I know, assembly is possible only used for critical performance, systems programming, operating system development and embedded systems nowadays. \\n\\n### \\nNow, is very general, because for what I know, changes happened gradually and at different phases in different industries and at different scales."},{"id":"What-is-a-question","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/What-is-a-question","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-11-questions/index.md","title":"What is a question?","description":"I\'ve come to realize that many of my concepts are highly intuitive and sometimes that works out well, but some other concepts are more complex and require a more elaborated mental model to support good conclusions.","date":"2024-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 11, 2024","tags":[{"label":"epistemology","permalink":"/blog/tags/epistemology"},{"label":"logic","permalink":"/blog/tags/logic"}],"readingTime":4.555,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Rogelio Lozano","title":"Explorer of principles of attraction of information","url":"https://github.com/RogelioLozano","imageURL":"https://github.com/RogelioLozano.png","key":"rogelio"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"What-is-a-question","title":"What is a question?","authors":["rogelio"],"tags":["epistemology","logic"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Is frontend automation near?","permalink":"/blog/Automating-frontend"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mental methods to solve problems","permalink":"/blog/Solving-logical-problems"}},"content":"I\'ve come to realize that many of my concepts are highly intuitive and sometimes that works out well, but some other concepts are more complex and require a more elaborated mental model to support good conclusions.\\n\\nThat is the case of questions. **What is a question?** I\'ll call this formulation WIQ\\n\\nThe first thing I realize when thinking about it is that is really difficult to analyze. First for the breadth and deepness of the ideas that come to my mind and second because my lake of known methodologies to approach endevours like this.\\n\\nSo I decide to go for it letting the flow of information in order to sink in my meaning of it. My intention is to create necessary conditions for the analysis but by no means I try to be exhaustive. It\'s beyond the current scope.\\n\\nSecond thing I note is my language limits (I recall Ludwig Wittgenstein aphorism: \\"Los l\xedmites de mi lenguaje son los l\xedmites de mi mundo\\" - I like the quote more in Spanish). When I noticed that WIQ is a self-referential formulation, then I inmediately fall into an ontological problem --\x3e Is there something I can compare to convey the idea of a self-referential formulation in the WIQ?\\n\\n### Narratives!!\\nPerhaps is really hard to synthetize a comparable example for what I\'m thinking and trying to communicate but narratives are great at transmitting highly dimensional-complex ideas!!\\n\\nSo, let\'s simplify it using a narrative because that is how I think I could undertand this situation better. Let\'s call a question X and an answer Y.\\n\\nI\'m something X whose existance is instanciated by a certain formulation of symbols (think of a symbol as a representation of some packet of information) that happend to be understood by other beings and generated by them in the first place. So I X, exist, conceptually but I\'m only realized when formulated, and my essence is inferred by the realized instances. When I\'m realized, many potential related questions coexist and are waiting to be formulated. Also, every time I\'m formulated, infinite instances of something called Y, Y\'s are potentially created that are connected to my current formulation X\' and intend to provide further information about X\'.\\n\\n### Analysis\\nI will not attempt to define what is X beyond saying that is a concept. I know that X exists because I create instances of it whose particular formulations are different from each other.\\n\\nSo I\'ll naively assume that I can know X via instances of it, and perhaps know better the nature of X exploring and analyzing instances of it that boils down to the realm of language. In different languages the particular symbols and syntactic rules change but let\'s focus on the two languages I know better. Let\'s forget in this approach about strict grammatical rules so to advance faster. More strict consideration will not invalidate the main arguments.\\n\\n+ In Spanish we formulate a question simply by preappending a \xbf and postappending a ? symbols to a sentence: \xbfEs esto una pregunta? Respuesta: S\xed\\n+ In English, let\'s simplify and formulate the question using only the symbol ? at the end. Is this a question? Answer: Yes\\n\\nSo there we have it. Let\'s explore X and their related Y\'s via instances of it. One particular interesting instance of it is the WIQ formulation:\\n\\n**What is a question?**\\n\\nNow I think is more clear to see that is a self-referential question. A particular instance of the concept that is asking for its own meaning. Is like X being forced (via me writing the formulation) to say: What am I? (Let\'s not question whether X is capable of instanciating itself or is only subjected to the will of the users of it, us, humans formulating questions... I\'ll assume the latter).\\n\\nOk, so now I have a mental model on which I can think about questions, i.e. A concept I can explore and analyze via instances of it that I formulate. And this heuristic turns out to be sufficient to give an answer to the WIQ.\\n\\n**What is a question?** Answer: It is a concept whose realization is via instances I formulate and can be explored analyzing those instances, the product of the analysis is one or more instances of connected information intended to further inform about the formulated question, we call these later instances answers.\\n\\nGreat, now I have a better mental model to explore questions!!!\\n\\nFor example, will programming web applications be completely automated?\\n\\nThinking of a question as a concept whose nature can be examined via particular instances of it, we can see that this particular question is an instance of a concept whose nature can be examined via particular instances of formulated questions. In this case the instance is: *Will programming web applications be completely automated?*\\n\\nEach question instantiated can be related to multiple instance questions whose core concept is the same. Answering those questions will inform more about the nature of the concepts I\'m trying to know about. I\'m not saying that all knowledge should ultimately be a concept that abstracts an intuition or perception, but I\'m saying that we can try to condensate information towards concepts via questions and see the whole process as an exploration of an unknown abstract idea.\\n\\nNow with solid mental model to explore and analyze questions, and one that encourages us to think about answering question as an explorative and always expanding process, fearless of uncertainty instead of static answers."},{"id":"Solving-logical-problems","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Solving-logical-problems","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-05-mental-meth/index.md","title":"Mental methods to solve problems","description":"To start smoothly, I\'ll share ideas I consider important to keep in mind when hunting counterexamples and rapidly discard conjectures that will go nowhere when solving difficult logical-constructive problems.

For example, there are only three distinct ways two intervals on the line can occur: as disjoint intervals, as overlapping intervals, and as properly nesting intervals, one within the other. All cases of three intervals can be systematically constructed by adding a third segment in each possible way to these three instances. \\n\\n- Hunt for the weakness \u2013 If a proposed algorithm is of the form \u201calways take the biggest\u201d (better known as the greedy algorithm), think about why that might prove to be the wrong thing to do.\\n\\n- Go for a tie \u2013 A devious way to break a greedy heuristic for example is to provide instances where everything is the same size. Suddenly the heuristic has nothing to base its decision on, and perhaps has the freedom to return something suboptimal as the answer.\\n\\n- Seek extremes \u2013 Many counter-examples are mixtures of huge and tiny, left and right, few and many, near and far. It is usually easier to verify or reason about extreme examples than more muddled ones. \\n\\n- Divide and conquer - A classical mental model to approach problems that can be divided into subproblems of smaller data size. The resulting structure after applying the method is usually a recursive tree where each node has the subproblem of smaller data size. One classical Example is MergeSort (with a runtime complexity of O(nlog(n)))"}]}')}}]);
